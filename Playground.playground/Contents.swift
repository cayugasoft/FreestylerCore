/*:
## _FreestylerCore_ lets you create *styles* and apply them to `UIView`s and `UIBarButtonItem`s.
 
 `Style` is a class which basically wraps array of closures. Closures take 1 argument â€“ some `Styleable`. `Styleable` is protocol for types that support styling. In iOS, these are `UIView` and `UIBarButtonItem`.
 
 Style can be applied to styleable using `apply(to:)` method or `<~` operator. When style is applied, its closures are called one by one with this styleable passed as argument.
 
 Styles can be combined using `Style.combine(_:)` method or `<~` operator. This creates new style which has all closures of given styles. Order of closures is preserved.
 
 It's possible to apply style to array of styleables; or apply array of styles to styleable; or even apply array of styles to array of styleables - everything could be done (surprise-surprise) using `<~` operator.

 ## Examples
 - Create style

let redBackground = Style {
    (view: UIView) in
    view.backgroundColor = .red
}

let grayBackground = Style {
    (view: UIView) in

/*: 
 Styles may have name. It's useful for debugging.
*/
let roundedCorners = Style("Rounded corners") {
    (view: UIView) in
    view.layer.cornerRadius = 5.0
}

/*:
 - Combine styles
 
 You can use `<~` operator for that.*/
let redAndRounded = redBackground <~ roundedCorners

/*: Or you can initialize style from array literal of other styles (note you have to explicitly declare type in this case).*/
let grayAndRounded: Style = [grayBackground, roundedCorners]

/*: 
 - Apply styles
 
 Try to uncomment these lines one by one and see how they work in **Timeline**.
