# FreestylerCore

## What is it?
When we develop our applications from designer's mockups, we often encounter the same visual patterns over and over again ‚Äì colors, fonts, etc. It's wise decision to keep them in one place in your app's code and reuse everywhere. That's exactly what *FreestylerCore* helps you to do.

*FreestylerCore* defines class `Style`. Style can be applied to `UIView` or `UIBarButtonItem`. Multiple `Style`s can be combined into one. See how to create your own styles and apply them in [Usage](#usage) section.
## Requirements
* iOS 8.0+
* Swift 3
* Xcode 8.0+

## Installation
### [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org)
1. Install **Cocoapods**: `sudo gem install cocoapods`
2. Create *Podfile* in your project directory.
3. Add in your *Podfile*:

	```
	use_frameworks!
	pod 'FreestylerCore', '~> 1.0'
	```
4. Run `pod install`
5. `import FreestylerCore` in your .swift files.

### Manually
1. Clone or download *FreestylerCore*
2. Drag `Source` folder to your project in Xcode; make sure **‚òëÔ∏è Copy items into destination's group folder (if needed)** option is checked.

## Usage
Here is example of style which adds rounded corners to the view:

```swift
let roundCornersStyle = Style("Round corners") {
    (view: UIView) in
    view.layer.cornerRadius = 5.0
}
```


### What is Style?
The simplest way to explain it is an example:

```swift
// "Round corners" is a name of this style.
// You are not required to provide a name but it is good thing to do.
// Style closure takes exactly 1 parameter.
// If you don't explicitly declare type of this parameter,
// it will be inferred as Styleable.
// However, it almost always makes sense to use explicit type,
// because it ensures that this style cannot be applied to wrong type.
let roundCornersStyle = Style("Round corners") {
    (view: UIView) in
    view.layer.cornerRadius = 5.0
}

// Style without a name.
let redBackgroundStyle = Style {
    (view: UIView) in
    view.backgroundColor = .redColor()
}

let button = UIButton()

// You apply style to view (or bar item) using <~ operator.
button <~ roundCornersStyle + redBackgroundStyle
// ^ Now button has rounded corners and red background. üéâ

// You can add styles using just simple + operator. 
// Notice that order matters and last addends take precedence to first.
let roundCornersAndRedBackground = roundCornersStyle + redBackgroundStyle
button <~ roundCornersAndRedBackground
// ^ The same effect as before.
```

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

iOS 8+
